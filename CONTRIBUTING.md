# Getting Involved

Code patches are not the only way to get involved: you can help the project by reporting bugs; improving docs; helping
others on [GitHub Issues](issues); tweeting to [@metreeca](https://twitter.com/metreeca); telling the world about
Metreeca ;-)

# Reporting Bugs

Before opening an [issue](https://github.com/metreeca/tile/issues) to report a bug, search open issues for similar cases
and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.

If you've really found a new bug, creating a helpful report using the dedicated template will make fixing it much easier
and quicker.

If you just want some help with the toolkit or your project, start
a [conversation](https://github.com/metreeca/tile/discussions) and describe your problem.

# Suggesting Features

If you think you have a good idea about improving or extending Metreeca/Tile, feel free to open
an [issues](https://github.com/metreeca/tile/issues), using the dedicated template.

Again search open suggestions and, if something is found, just add any additional details in the comments.
